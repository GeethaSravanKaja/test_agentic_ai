- **Ship Mode**: Must be string (VARCHAR) data type, maximum 30 characters
- **Customer Name**: Must be string (VARCHAR) data type, maximum 100 characters
- **Product Name**: Must be string (VARCHAR) data type, maximum 200 characters

### 2.3 Value Range Constraints

- **Profit**: Minimum value >= -999999.99, Maximum value <= 999999.99
- **Quantity**: Minimum value >= 1, Maximum value <= 10000
- **Discount**: Minimum value >= 0.0000, Maximum value <= 1.0000
- **Order Date**: Must be within reasonable business date range (2010-2025)

- **Transaction level**: Each transaction should have unique identifier
- **Customer level**: Customer names should be consistent across records
- **Product level**: Product names should be consistent across records

## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Operational Rules
- **Sales calculation**: Total sales by category must equal sum of individual sales records within that category
- **Profit calculation**: Average profit by region must be calculated as sum of profits divided by count of records in that region
- **Order counting**: Order count by ship mode must count each record as one order
- **Customer analysis**: Customer acquisition rate must be calculated based on first order date per customer
- **Product analysis**: Product performance must be measured by sales, profit, and quantity metrics

### 3.2 Reporting Logic
- **Category analysis**: Sales must be grouped by Category field for category-wise reporting
- **Regional analysis**: Profit must be grouped by Region field for regional performance reporting
- **Shipping analysis**: Records must be grouped by Ship Mode field for logistics reporting
- **Customer analysis**: Records must be grouped by Customer Name for customer behavior analysis
- **Product analysis**: Records must be grouped by Product Name for product performance analysis
- **Temporal analysis**: Records must be grouped by Order Date for time-series analysis

### 3.3 Transformation Guidelines
- **Aggregation method**: Use SUM function for sales totals, AVG function for profit averages, COUNT function for order counts
- **Grouping method**: Use GROUP BY clause on respective dimension fields (Category, Region, Ship Mode, Customer Name, Product Name)
- **Date calculations**: Use date functions for calculating delivery time, sales growth rate, and temporal trends
- **KPI calculations**: Calculate profit margin as (Profit/Sales)*100, average order value as Sales/Quantity
- **Null handling**: Exclude records with null values in key fields from aggregations

### 3.4 Data Processing Rules
- **File format**: Input data must be in CSV format with header row
- **Schema inference**: Data types should be automatically inferred during data loading
- **Error handling**: Invalid records should be logged but not stop the processing
- **Data validation**: Implement data quality checks before processing
- **Incremental loading**: Support for incremental data updates based on Order Date

### 3.5 Performance Rules
- **Data loading**: CSV file must be loaded with header=True and inferSchema=True options
- **Processing efficiency**: Use Spark DataFrame operations for optimal performance
- **Memory management**: Ensure proper Spark session management with explicit stop() call
- **Partitioning**: Consider partitioning data by Region or Category for better performance
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed DataFrames for improved performance

### 3.6 Enhanced KPI Rules
- **Sales Growth Rate**: Calculate period-over-period growth using Order Date
- **Profit Margin by Category**: Calculate as (Total Profit / Total Sales) * 100 per category
- **Customer Acquisition Rate**: Track new customers based on first appearance in dataset
- **Average Order Value**: Calculate as Total Sales / Total Orders
- **Shipping Performance**: Calculate delivery time as Ship Date - Order Date
- **Product Performance**: Rank products by sales, profit, and quantity metrics
